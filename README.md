# Image2paint
Inspired by "painting by number", this tool creates a black-and-white colouring plate from a chosen image. In the tool, you can already fill in the colouring template with different colours or save it for later use. 

A paint-by-number painting is a type of artwork in the form of a colouring plate with tiny numbers indicating which colour needs to be painted where. This is something that became a popular activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and is also a personal hobby of mine.

# Instructions
To use this creative tool, you need to find yourself a nice image to turn into a colouring template. If you found it, put it in the "images" directory. Change the name of the file to something short. 

1.	Open the program _image2paint_main.pde_
2.	Go to the tweakable variables. Change the filename into your filename (with extension). 
3.	Run the program
4.	If the picture is not satisfactory: tweak colorAmount, colorRange, and BLURValue until the desired output. 
a.	Default values (best results among multiple images) are as follows: 
-	colorAmount = 25 - if more colours are added, the result becomes more detailed, making it more complex
-	colorRange = 600 - less/more variation in colours
-	BLURValue = 3 - lower value = more detailed, higher value = less detailed

5.	Pick your colours/stroke/saturation/brightness to paint the template! Did you make a mistake? Press on the eraser and erase your mistakes. 
6.	You can save your artwork multiple times (it will not be overwritten in the same session) with the save button.
